DJMixing Application:

Three libraries:
1) Fourier Transform to find specific frequencies

2) Sound Mixing library to edit our audio files for a DJ

3) Beats Per Minute Library to tell our sound mixing library the speed of a song

Week 1:
Work on library 1 to find specific frequencies. We want a spectrogram completed as soon as possible.
