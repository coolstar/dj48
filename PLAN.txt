DJMixing Application:

Three libraries:
1) Fourier Transform to find specific frequencies

2) Sound Mixing library to edit our audio files for a DJ

3) Beats Per Minute Library to tell our sound mixing library the speed of a song

Week 1:
Work on library 1 to find specific frequencies. We want a spectrogram completed as soon as possible. By the end of the day, we should have a html file with Javascript running, in which the sound file can play, and be able to run the Fourier Transform on.

After completing a spectrogram, we will work getting the Beats Per Minute library to display the bpm.


Then, we will work on using the sound mixing library to mix sounds.
